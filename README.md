Demo: [jason5ng32.github.io/MyIP](https://jason5ng32.github.io/MyIP/)

Notes: Please note that some data on the demo site may not be displayed because it has been accessed frequently recently (I didn't expect that either). To circumvent this, you can deploy the site yourself.

[![Deploy with Vercel](https://vercel.com/button)](https://vercel.com/new/clone?repository-url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fjason5ng32%2FMyIP&project-name=MyIP&repository-name=MyIP)

## Main Features

1. **View Your IPs**: Detects and displays your local IP, sourcing from multiple IPv4 and IPv6 providers.
2. **IP Information**: Presents detailed information for all IP addresses, including country, region, ASN, geographic location, and more.
3. **Availability Check**: Tests the accessibility of various websites, such as Google, GitHub, YouTube, ChatGPT, and others.
4. **WebRTC Detection**: Identifies the IP address used during WebRTC connections.
5. **DNS Leak Test**: Shows DNS endpoint data to evaluate the risk of DNS leaks when using VPNs or proxies.
6. **Dark Mode**: Automatically toggles between dark and daylight modes based on system settings, with an option for manual switching.
7. **Minimalist Mode**: A mobile-optimized mode that shortens page length for quick access to essential information..
8. **Arbitrary IP Information**: Provides a tool for querying information about any IP address.
9. **PWA Supported**ï¼šCan be added as a desktop app on your phone as well as a Chrome app on your computer.
10. Based on availability test results, it indicates whether global internet access is currently feasible.
11. English and Chinese supported.

## How to Use

The tool is almost ready to use straight out of the box. Just download the entire codebase and deploy it on your local machine or server. No additional setup is required.

There are 2 ways to display a map showing the location of an IP:

1. Click on the + Add button next to the map display button and fill in the API KEY, then map function will be enabled and always available in current browser.
2. Or, you can modify `res/app.js`, in the `data` section, locate:

```javascript
bingMapAPIKEY: '',
```

Enter your Bing Map API Key here. Upon doing so, the map functionality on the homepage will activate automatically for all users.

Applying for this API key is free and includes up to 120,000 requests per year at no cost, adequate for personal use. For larger projects, consider adjusting the program to avoid embedding the key in the frontend code.

If you don't need map functionality, the program can also be deployed easily with a single click on Vercel.

## Advanced Usage

If you're using a proxy for internet access, consider adding this rule to your proxy configuration (modify it according to your client). This setup lets you check both your real IP and the IP when using the proxy:

```ini
# IP Testing
IP-CIDR,1.0.0.1/32,DIRECT,no-resolve
IP-CIDR6,2606:4700:4700::1111/128,DIRECT,no-resolve
DOMAIN-SUFFIX,ipify.org,Proxy
```

## Additional Notes

70% of the code for this program was not written by me, but generated through ChatGPT. After about 50 rounds of back-and-forth and some minor manual adjustments, all the code was completed.
